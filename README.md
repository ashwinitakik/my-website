## 🚀 How to Deploy on GitHub Pages

Follow these steps carefully:

1. **Push your project** to a public repository on GitHub (for example: `my-website`).

2. Go to your repository on GitHub.

3. Click on the **Settings** tab (top right side of the repo page).

4. Scroll down the left sidebar and click **Pages**.

5. Under the section **Build and Deployment → Source**, select:

   * **Branch:** `main`
   * **Folder:** `/ (root)`

6. Click **Save**.

7. Wait for 1–2 minutes. You’ll see a green message box with your **website link** — for example:

   > Your site is live at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`

8. Click that link, and your website will open live on the internet.

## 🖌️ Customization Tips

* Edit `index.html` to change text and layout.
* Add `style.css` for colors, fonts, and page styling.
* Add more HTML files (like `about.html`) and link them.
* After editing, push changes to update the live site:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Updated site content"
git push
```

GitHub Pages will automatically rebuild your website.
